Artemis is a high performance Entity System framework for games, written in Go, 
and is a framework to manage entities in a game world. 
It is inspired by Entity Systems are the future of MMORPG articles by Adam Martin on t-machine.org.
We also borrowed ideas from Ted Brown who implemented a simple high-performance Entity System in Processing.

Basically, this is a Java port of known Artemis project
